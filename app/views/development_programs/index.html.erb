    <h4 class="text-center text-muted">Overview</h4>

    <p>
      With the World Wide Web connecting experiences from across the globe, many of todayâ€™s
      professional skills can be effectively self-taught outside the traditional and costly
      classroom method. The problem is no matter how talented a person becomes, they will still
      lack an official accreditation for their skill. The classic certificates can
      expand employment opportunities, but they are difficult to plan and hard to verify by
      employers. Our modular Development Program is designed to plan, track, and accredit your
      skill development effortlessly. The Development Program will make use of industry
      standardized certificates that are convenient to share, and electronically verifiable
      for your future employers.

      The Development program not only allows you to track your development on your own time,
      but it also allows you to:

      In addition to our free basic introductory workshops, you can now achieve higher level of
      technical abilities in each skill offered by the development program. As you progress in
      building your skill sets, you will unlock new tasks and challenges designed to push your
      limits into a whole new level. Once you are confident in your abilities you can tackle our
      proficiency projects. The hands-on proficiency projects are qualifying projects put together
      by our expert team to test your abilities to complete a project at a specific level of
      quality (intermediate, advanced, mastery) upon satisfactory completion of each proficiency
      project you will be rewarded with the appropriate digital badges.
