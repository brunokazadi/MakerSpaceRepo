    <br>

    <p>
      There have been many changes to the volunteer program with comparison to previous years.
      The goal of the new program is for the volunteers to build their skills in either the Makerspace
      or Brunsfield by getting them to complete tasks generated by the space managers. These tasks
      will be available on Makerepo and the volunteers can sign up for them once they complete
      necessary training.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, the volunteers will have to complete two mandatory trainings, a 3D printing workshop
      and their basic training in the MTC. If they have done the training within the past year and have
      been actively using the spaces, they don’t need to repeat it. Once they have completed both of
      those, they will need to shadow for 6 hours in the Makerspace and 6 hours in Brunsfield.
    </p>

    <p>The goal of these shadowing shifts is to get the volunteers comfortable with the spaces by
      learning the vibes of the spaces and getting exposure to some of the other things that can be
      done. From the perspective of the staff, I ask that you use your judgement as to what you want
      them to do when they are shadowing. You can give them odd tasks; they can watch you work
      on projects or just help out in general. I don’t want them to be sitting there on their phones
      doing nothing for an hour and a half, they need to learn something. It’s important that they are
      hearing some of the questions being asked by students to learn how to answer them and
      therefore learning more information about the spaces.</p>

    <p>I will be scheduling the shadowing shifts based on their availability and will give you guys a
      heads up as to when to expect volunteers. Once they complete their shadowing shifts, if you
      can please fill out the google form below with their information and a quick summary of what
      they did that would be awesome so I can keep track of what they have done and will know
      when they are ready to be accepted into the program and get access to the task list.</p>

    <p>Once they have completed their trainings and shadowing, I will accept them as a volunteer on
      Makerepo and they will gain access to the task list. The task list will have various small project
      for the volunteers to accomplish on it with a suggested number of hours it will take to complete
      and then a corresponding amount of CC points they will get from completing the task. CC points
      are essentially translated into Makerstore gift cards. Students can use them to purchase things
      from the Makerstore or can use them to pay for their proficiency projects. Proficiency projects
      are the test project students can complete once they have completed a suggested number of
      hours building the skill of their choice and feel they are ready to move up to the next level.
      Upon successful completion of the proficiency project, they will receive a badge which will be
      visible on their Linkedin profile. They start at basic proficiency upon completing the workshop,
      and can move up all the way to Mastery. This will be implemented in January, but I have let the
      students know as part of my info session that this is coming.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Volunteers will also have the opportunity to sign up for tasks on Makerepo such as “open hours
      in the Makerspace” and for specific events like Makercon. They can receive volunteer hours for
      doing these tasks which I will approve for them on both Makerepo and the community
      engagement navigator if they are registered, however they will not get rewarded with CC points
      for doing these tasks. CC points are only given for specific task completion.</p>

    <p>If people are interested in volunteering, tell them to reach out to me by email at
      <a href="mailto:volunteer@makerepo.com">volunteer@makerepo.com</a> and I will send them all the information they need. If there are
      previous volunteers, they still need to go through the required trainings and if they have
      questions about it tell them to email me and we can talk about their specific case. My goal is to
      have it as systematic as possible however there are always exceptions and I am going to do my
      best to accommodate within reason.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions for me, please feel free to either email me either at
      <a href="mailto:volunteer@makerepo.com">volunteer@makerepo.com</a> or at my personal email <a href="mailto:schia015@uottawa.ca">schia015@uottawa.ca</a> and I am also on
      slack and can probably get back to you faster on there.</p>
